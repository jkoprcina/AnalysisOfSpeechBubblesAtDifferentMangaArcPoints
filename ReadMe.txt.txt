Finding correlation between speech bubbles and story progression in manga

A project aimed to process images into vectors showing the positioning of speech bubbles.
They will then be used to look for corelations between positioning and number of occurences of said speech bubbles in different story points (the beginning, middle and end of a manga story arc).
The project is made as a part of the course Text and Multimedia Mining taken at Radboud University, Nijmegen.

Because of downloading manga being illegal, the data will be webscraped and used without permanent downloading.
A big thanks to Muntaser Syed and Jasmin Omanovic as their code was used to simplify the project (can be found at https://github.com/jemsbhai/comicvision).
